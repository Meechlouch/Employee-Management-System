## :memo: Description

Employee Management System is a CLI application that allows a user to manage company records. Using mySQL, information
about the company is saved to a database and can be accessed using node.js. Inquirer than prompts the user while tables
are shown for the user to reference depending on the task trying to be accomplished. The EMP application has various
functionalities to allow a user to view, create, or update company records such as view/add/delete employees, company
roles and departments, update employee positions, managers, and manager's position and some other more powerful features
like looking up employees by the manager or looking up the total utilize budget of a particular department. The
application is formatted in such a way to make user readability viewable.
